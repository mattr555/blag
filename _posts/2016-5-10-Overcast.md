title: "Intermezzo: Overcast Player Review"
---

While the origins of the term "podcasting" are murky and filled with cease and desist letters from Apple, the actual basis of podcasting has only two parts: the _feed_ and the _podcatcher_. If you have these two components, you have a podcast that can be followed by an audience.

As it turns out, you don't need to have an Apple device to listen to a podcast. While the term "podcast" comes from "iPod" and "broadcast" (according to Apple), any device that has an internet connection can potentially have software to follow a podcast. A podcatcher will automatically read from the feed at a set interval to see if there are any new posts available. The feed is an archive of every available post and points to the audio file for the actual show. In effect, any program that can read a feed and download and play the linked audio is a podcatcher.

Marco Arment, an independent app developer who previously worked on tumblr and Instapaper, saw an opening in the podcast app market for iOS and decided to take on Apple's built-in offering. He called his app Overcast and marketed it on his popular blog and podcast, the _Accidential Tech Podcast_. His app includes the basics that everyone would expect: the ability to subscribe to podcasts, choose from a listing, and basic playback controls like skipping and speed control. However, Overcast shines in the few minute details:

+ **Smart Speed**: Cuts out the pauses in conversation for breaths, etc. Can affect the dramatic flow of the story though: most noticeable in pregnant pauses in dramas like _Serial_.
+ **Device Syncing**: It saves your progress through your current show as well as your subscribed list to the cloud for seamless syncing across devices.
+ **Easy access to Show Notes**: Also called the description, these notes sometimes contain links and other references that the shows' hosts are making. In the iOS app you had to back out of the main screen to read the show notes.
+ **Voice EQ**: Get nice, deep voice tones, especially good for listening in the car.
+ **Easy Sharing**: Easily tweet a time-stamped link to a show that can be played directly online, no more awkward description of the time or dodgy links to non-standard sites. Also allows you to find shows that the people you follow on Twitter like.

For the low price of free, you can't go wrong with upgrading your podcast experience using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/).
