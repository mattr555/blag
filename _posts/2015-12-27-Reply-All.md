As far as radio journalism goes, [Reply All](http://replyall.limo), from Alex Blumberg's Gimlet Media, is top of the line.

On radio shows, the hosts are everything. _Radiolab_ wouldn't be anywhere without the iconic style of Jad and Rob, _This American Life_ needs Ira's snarky intonation, and _Serial_ would just be another murder story if it weren't for Sarah Koenig's storytelling ability. Reply All's success lies in its hosts' dynamic as well. Reply All was born from two guys working at WNYC who entered an office competition for a new show together. Although their pitch for a show about the internet didn't win, _On the Media_ [picked up](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3255ub/we_are_pj_vogt_and_alex_goldman_host_of_the_reply/cq81ud2) Alex Goldman and PJ Vogt's idea and spun it off into a new podcast called TLDR. When the show picked up popularity, Planet Money's producer Alex Blumberg invited the duo to his brand new venture and the rest is history.

While the show is billed as "a show about the internet," this is a rather tongue-in-cheek description. While all of the stories depict the internet in some way (e.g. Yik Yak), the real story is about the people who use it or are influenced by it (e.g. [the enabling of racist and offensive discussion on Colgate University's campus](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/46-yik-yak-returns/)). Where one news report might talk about Twitter and how it enables fans to connect, Reply All interviews one guy and how he has [thousands of One Direction fans harassing him](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/6-one-direction-larry-shippers/) because of his last name.

Some of their most successful shows are about more serious topics, like the Yik Yak episode from above or the [episode](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/28-shipped-to-timbuktu/) where an old Girl Guide journal uncovers the lives of girls who lived through a Japanese concentration camp in China. Truthfully, a lot of strange and sad things happen on the internet, and Reply All almost always takes the right angle to tell these stories.

My favorite segments of the show are the ones that are more casual and involve both hosts. They do a segment called "Yes Yes No" where they attempt to explain weird tweets or other internet phenomena to their boss. They also do one called "Super Tech Support" where Alex, who was once an IT guy, fixes problems that people have while navigating the internet (their debut episode involved trying to cancel a recurring housekeeping service). One of my favorite episodes was one about freedom, where the hosts [took a day off](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/) and explored New York City in lieu of a real story.

+ _Duration_: around 30 minutes.
+ _Editing_: professionally done, as Gimlet has hired some of the best engineers from public radio. They even did an [episode](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/16-the-secret-formula/) of StartUp about how it's done.
+ _Ads_: I used to love Reply All's ads. They were like funny mini-stories about what Squarespace sites they would make (like [goldman.gripe](http://goldman.gripe)). Now they've switched to more scripted reads like the abhorrent "PC does what" ads.
+ _Music_: What the show loses in ads gains twofold in music. Their themes are written by the mysterious [Breakmaster Cylinder](https://soundcloud.com/breakmaster-cylinder), a guy on SoundCloud who is a big fan of podcasts and writes awesome beats.
+ _Format_: _This American Life_-style stories, well-paced and funny where appropriate.
+ _Schedule_: While Gimlet has had problems keeping a consistent schedule with their other shows, I can always count on finding Reply All on my phone every Thursday.
+ _Overall_: really good stories about the strange and interesting stuff that happens on and off the Internet. 9/10
