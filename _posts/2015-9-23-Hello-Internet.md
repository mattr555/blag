It seems fitting to start my blag adventure with how I started my podcast adventure in the first place: with [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/).

I got into podcasting when I procured my trusty iPhone 5S at the beginning of Junior year. I quickly found that just browsing Wikipedia or whatever on the hour-long bus ride to school wasn't sufficient enough for entertainment, and sleeping just felt uncomfortable, especially when I knew I had a world of possibilities in my pocket. I also knew that I couldn't just watch videos or use a lot of data, and I wanted to be able to at least close my eyes to enjoy the entertainment.

Enter podcasts. It's the perfect media: it only requires your ears to enjoy it, and it can be downloaded to your device to listen to at your leisure. I only needed a show to listen to!

Luckily for me, Hello Internet was just starting to pick up. Prominent educational YouTuber [CGPGrey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey), famous for his "Grey Explains" videos, including the very popular [The United Kingdom Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10), had just announced a new podcast venture with fellow YouTuber Brady Haran. Brady is the man behind many YouTube channels, including my very favorite channel, [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile). Needless to say, I was very excited to learn that there is now even more entertainment from some of my favorite people on the internet.

The podcast itself is in a freeform discussion format. It follows a general pattern of follow-up from last episode, then "catch-up", where the hosts talk about what happened in their lives since the last episode, then finally discussion of new topics. This format allows a lot of listener participation, especially when the hosts ask for general polls and opinions of the listenership. The hosts are active on the [CGPGrey subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cgpgrey), where they engage listeners in discussion after the show is posted. 

Favorite topics to discuss include flags (including the suckyness of the US state flags), Apple products/cultship, how to escape your job as a teacher or print journalist and instead make money as an Internet personality, how to deal with Google and the YouTube system, what listeners do while listening to the show, and plane crashes. Oftentimes the podcast serves as a "bonus feature" from the creators of the videos themselves, as in the example of the [Mile of Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r3cEKZiLmg) Numberphile video. And also, using their clout in the YouTube world and the power of a strong listener base, they can do some cool stuff, like the recent episode at the Royal Society to discuss interesting, old objects from science, like the very first manuscript of _Principia_ itself!!

+ *Duration*: around 2 hours
+ *Editing*: very tightly edited to take out the ums and aahs, but still feels like a natural conversation. Grey has said that there are around 300 cuts per episode, but I only ever notice a few.
+ *Ads*: ~2 minute long reads from the hosts, I usually skip them.
+ *Music*: none
+ *Format*: freeform conversation, never feels like a part was cut short for time or interestingness. No hard-set topics to discuss each episode, so conversation feels more lively and natural.
+ *Schedule*: no set schedule, but are generally twice per month.
+ *Overall*: I love hearing the different stories and opinions they have to bring to the table. 9/10
