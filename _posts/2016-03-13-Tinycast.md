Don't count out the nerds who can research and write awesome scripts. Matt Croydon delivers tiny informational bites to your ears with [The Tinycast](http://tinycast.in).

I love learning weird, new things in short informational bursts. My YouTube subscription list can certainly attest to this. It includes educational content creators such as [CGP Grey](http://youtube.com/cgpgrey), [Numberphile](http://youtube.com/numberphile), and [Tom Scott](http://youtube.com/enyay). I figured there had to be similar podcasts that can deliver a well thought-out, but clear and concise lesson. I tried to get into Stuff You Should Know or Stuff You Missed in History Class, but their 1-hour+ episode lengths were too daunting for me, and the conversational way these episodes were presented left me yearning for a clearer conclusion.

Then I came across The Tinycast. I found it in a list of podcasts that Alex Goldman, host of Reply All, likes. The shows are all less than 15 minutes long and include short informational blurbs on all sorts of seemingly mundane but actually kind of cool topics. My favorite episode is a [seven minute piece](http://tinycast.in/2015/09/18/oh-bollards/) on bollards, the poles that stick up out of the ground and keep pedestrians safe from cars. The script is very well put together and the shows feature scores from awesome artists, including Breakmaster Cylinder, the genius behind Reply All's music.

I'm writing about this show because the creator, Matt Croydon, also published a short article on how he produces the show. He got a cheap microphone from Amazon and tracks the show in his closet, where the sound is dampened by the clothes. The simplicity of it all inspired me to create a podcast for a project at school and follow his advice:

> Put your voice to tape. Get it out there. Don’t worry about all this other stuff. My guess is that you’ll get hooked and want to do it better next time. And better the time after that. It’s a wonderful rabbit hole called radio. Or podcasting.

* _Duration_: less than 15 minutes. It's "tiny" for a reason!
* _Editing_: The production quality is great and affords for a nice, short, informative show.
* _Ads_: short post-roll ads that don't detract from the experience -- he took the Roman Mars approach.
* _Music_: Lots of cool electronic-ish scores from talented artists.
* _Format_: Love the style and simplicity of the show. It really shows how important it is to have a well-written script before recording.
* _Schedule_: Unfortunately, the last episode was published in September. I really hope he gets around to making more shows.
* _Overall_: Quick and informative 8/10
