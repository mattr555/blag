While many may only know him as the PC in the "Get a Mac" ad campaign, John Hodgman is still active as a minor podcast celebrity!

I first came across the Judge's work in the _New York Times Magazine_ under the column "Judge John Hodgman Rules." To be honest, I thought at first that he was a real judge that took the time to write a column every week, and was always sure to look out for it in the One Page Magazine. When I started listening to podcasts, I noticed at the bottom of the column it mentioned the show's existence, and downloaded a case to get a taste.

And boy, was the first case I listened to a doozy. A guy brings the case against his friend who has a [complicated system](http://maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgkin-episode-181-amicus-grief) regarding how she categorizes friends. It was strange and delightful, and the reactions from the judge and his bailiff, Jesse Thorn of NPR's _Bullseye_, are priceless. The act of bringing normal people as guests onto the show requires quick wit, and Hodgman's humorist skill shows in this regard.

Each episode starts out with an "obscure cultural reference," where guests can guess the reference that the judge quotes for an immediate judgement in their favor. Indeed, the show is filled with many references that a 16-year-old like myself wouldn't understand, but can appreciate as nerdy arcana from Hodgman's youth. John then asks each party about their side of the story and drills deep to find the crux of the issue. It's always interesting to see the real underlying problem to a seemingly benign conflict, like how the issue of [hiring a maid](http://maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgman-episode-235-grime-and-punishment) is actually an issue of pride for the husband raised from humble beginnings.

At the end, the judge delivers his verdict in an often compelling and sharp monologue that always leaves both parties happy. While the conflicts are never major problems to lose sleep over, as this is a fake Internet court, Hodgman chooses the sensible and correct solution every time. Occasionally guests will take the place of Jesse Thorn to provide additional insight on conflicts as expert witnesses. Altogether, _Judge John Hodgman_ is a funny and thought-provoking comedy.

+ _Duration_: 45 min-1 hour
+ _Editing_: not much is done, which makes sense, as the show relies on its spontaneous discussion.
+ _Ads_: _JJHo_ is on the Maximum Fun podcast network, which is mostly listener-supported. Other than an annual beg-a-thon, they run one or two 30 second ads at natural breakpoints in the show.
+ _Music_: none
+ _Format_: normal guests submit their cases for adjudication. The call-in format allows for spontaneous discussion and quick improvisational comedy from the hosts.
+ _Schedule_: very faithfully released every Wednesday.
+ _Overall_: funny and sharp, I can really get into the discussion when it's not too obscure. 8/10
